**this project is in the process of being rebuilt using Preact for a better UI**

### **[fsm](https://alialhasnawi.github.io/fsm/)**
*Extension to [Evan Wallace's](http://madebyevan.com/) fsm for state elimination*
- Draw deterministic and nondeterministic finite automata.
- Eliminate states using the `\` key. Only states not marked with a starting arrow or as accepting can be eliminated.
- Perform subset construction by right clicking. Subset construction will not occur without a clearly defined start.
- Uses the [shunting-yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm).


### Running
To run a working copy of the code, clone the repository and run `npm init` followed by `npm run serve`, and then open http://localhost:9000/ on your device.
